				<h2>What is Katsu Curry?</h2>
				<p>Katsu curry is just a variation of Japanese curry with a chicken cutlet on top. I have used a store-bought block of Japanese curry roux which is commonly used in Japanese households. Chicken Cutlet (Japanese version of chicken schnitzel) brings the Japanese curry up to the next level. It’s so delicious and filling.

					It is not an exaggeration to say that Japanese curry rice (カレーライス, pronounce it as ‘karē raisu’) is the national home cooking dish. Everyone, particularly children, love it. When Japanese people say ‘having a curry tonight’, it is the Japanese curry that is made from the store-bought block of curry roux.</p>

				<h3>Directions</h3>
				<dl>
					<dt>Preparing the curry:</dt>
					<br/>
					
						<dd>Add oil into a pot and heat over medium high heat.</dd>
						<br/>
						<dd>Add onion and sauté for a few minutes or until the onion becomes translucent and edges start getting slightly burnt.</dd>
						<br/>
						<dd>Add potatoes and carrots into the pot and stir for a couple of minutes or until the surface of the vegetables starts getting cooked.</dd>
						<br/>
						<dd>Add water and turn the heat up to bring it to a boil. Then reduce the heat to medium low and simmer for about 7 minutes or until the vegetables are nearly cooked through (note 3).</dd>
						<br/>
						<dd>Break the curry roux cake into small blocks along the lines and add them into the pot. Stir gently to blend the curry roux.</dd>
						<br/>
						<dd>Place a lid on and cook over low heat for about 10 minutes or until the curry roux is completely dissolved. Stir occasionally.</dd>
						<br/>
						<dd>Check the consistency of the sauce. It should be like béchamel sauce. If too thick, adjust with some water. If too thin, cook further without the lid. It will thicken when cooled down as well.</dd>
						<br/>
						<dd>Turn the heat off.</dd>
						<br/>
						<br/>

					<dt>Preparing the chicken cutlet:</dt><br/>
						<dd>If the thickness of the thigh fillet is not even, cut into the thick part of the meat horizontally without cutting all the way through, then open it so that the fillet’s thickness becomes consistent.</dd>
						<br/>
						<dd>Season the chicken all over with salt and pepper.</dd>
						<br/>
						<dd>Place flour, egg and breadcrumbs in a shallow plate or bowl individually and line them up in this order. Place an additional clean plate or a small baking tray next to the breadcrumbs.</dd>
						<br/>
						<dd> Working one fillet at a time, coat a fillet with flour, shake off excess flour, then place it in the egg and coat all over. Allow excess egg to drip, then transfer to the breadcrumbs.</dd>
						<br/>
						<dd>Cover the entire fillet with breadcrumbs, making sure that a good layer of breadcrumbs is stuck on both sides. Repeat for the rest of the fillets.
							Heat oil in a deep frying pan to 338-356°F. The amount of oil should be about 1¼-1⅜” deep</dd>
						<br/>
						<dd>Gently place a fillet into the oil. Depending on the size of the pan, you may fry more than one at a time, but do not overcrowd.</dd>
						</br>
						<dd>Fry for about 3-4 minutes or until the bottom side is browned. Using tongs, flip the fillet and cook for further 3-4 minutes until the other side is browned. </dd>
						<br/>
						<dd>Transfer the cutlet onto a tray lined with a couple of layers of paper towel to drain excess oil. Rest for 5 minutes.</dd>
						<br/>
						<dd>Cut each chicken cutlet into 1” wide strips.</dd>
						<br/>
				</dl>

            <div class = "recipe-text-notes">
				<h3>Notes</h3>
				<dl>
					<dt>Serving:</dt>
					<br/>
						<dd>Place a cup of hot cooked rice onto one side of a plate. Place the chicken cutlet pieces next to the rice, leaning them on the rice so that there will be a space to pour the curry.</dd>
						<br/>
						<dd>Pour curry next to the chicken cutlet and serve immediately.</dd>
						<br/>
						<br/>

					<dt>Notes:</dt><br/>
						<dd>If the carrot is fat, you may halve or quarter it lengthwise, then slice it.</dd>
						<br/>
						<dd>I happened to have a mild curry pack. But you can use medium hot or hot curry or even another brand instead of House Food.</dd>
						<br/>
						<dd>Different kinds/brands of roux might require different amounts of water. Please follow the instructions on the pack.</dd>
						<br/>
						<dd> Put a skewer through to the potato/carrot. If the skewer can easily get through, the vegetables are cooked.</dd>
						<br/>
						<dd>You may pre-make the curry and serve it later. The curry can be kept for few days in the fridge, 1 month in the freezer.</dd>
						<br/>
						<dd>When the curry cools down, the sauce thickens. The consistency of the sauce should be like béchamel sauce. Check the consistency of the sauce after re-heating and if too thick, adjust with water.</dd>
						<br/>
						<dd> To defrost your curry, see the post for two different methods.</dd>
						<br/>
						<dd> I did not use it, but you can add Fukujinzuke (Condiment for Japanese Curry) if you have it.</dd>
